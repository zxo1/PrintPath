# PrintPath


PrintPath is a Windows application designed to generate timelapse G-code files for 3D printing with Klipper and Marlin firmware.  
It creates smooth 360° orbit camera paths around your 3D models, capturing snapshots at each layer to produce stunning timelapse videos.

## Features

- Drag & drop G-code file support with orbit timelapse generation  
- Configurable settings: firmware type (Klipper, Marlin), Z offset, orbit speed, dwell time  
- Supports multiple snapshot modes with user script extensibility  
- 2D preview of snapshot path with selectable camera views (3/4 or front)  
- Model-aware orbiting for multi-model prints with user selection

## Getting Started

1. Drop your G-code file onto the app icon to generate a timelapse-enhanced file.  
2. Run the app without input to open the settings dialog for customization.  
3. Adjust settings and select desired snapshot mode or scripts.  

## Planned Features

- Advanced user scripting with Python and G-code templates  
- Layer range filtering and snapshot preview animation  
- Build plate and safe zone configuration  
- Export snapshot metadata for external use
