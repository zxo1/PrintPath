PrintPath: G-code Post-Processor for Timelapse Camera PathsPrintPath is a desktop application designed to post-process G-code files, enabling the insertion of custom camera movements for creating stunning timelapses of your 3D prints. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy configuration, dynamic script loading for flexible camera paths, and a built-in G-code previewer.‚ú® FeaturesGUI Interface: User-friendly desktop application built with PyQt5.Dynamic Script Loading: Easily add and switch between different post-processing scripts.G-code Previewer: Visualize your print's toolpath and the planned camera snapshot points in 2D (Top/Front views).Customizable Settings: Adjust global settings (travel speed, dwell time, retraction) and script-specific parameters through the GUI.Firmware Agnostic: Supports both Klipper and Marlin firmware (configurable per script).Automatic Saving: Processed G-code files are automatically saved with a descriptive filename.Extensible: Create your own Python scripts to define unique camera movements.üöÄ InstallationPrintPath requires Python 3.x and PyQt5.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUser/PrintPath.git
cd PrintPath
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:pip install PyQt5
Create the scripts directory:Ensure there's a folder named scripts in the root directory of the application. This is where your G-code post-processing scripts will reside.mkdir scripts
Place example scripts:Copy the provided example scripts (e.g., orbit.py, arc.py) into the scripts directory.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è UsageRun the application:# Ensure your virtual environment is active
python main.py
Open a G-code file:Go to File > Open G-code... and select your .gcode file. The viewer will parse and display a preview of your print.Select a Script:Choose a post-processing script from the "Select Script" dropdown (e.g., "orbit", "arc"). The available settings on the left panel will dynamically update based on the selected script.Adjust Settings:Modify the global settings (Travel Speed, Dwell Time, Retract Length, Z-Hop Height) and any script-specific settings (e.g., Number of Snapshots, Orbit Radius) to customize your camera path.Process G-code:Click the "Go!" button. The application will process your G-code, inserting the camera movement commands defined by the selected script. A progress bar will indicate activity.Review and Save:After processing, the processed snapshot points will appear in the previewer. The "Go!" button will change to "Open your_file_name_mode.gcode", allowing you to open the processed file directly with your system's default application. You can also manually save the processed G-code via File > Save Processed G-code or File > Save Processed G-code As....‚öôÔ∏è Custom ScriptsPrintPath is designed to be highly extensible through custom Python scripts.Each script should be a .py file placed in the scripts directory and must contain:# SCRIPT_SETTINGS: comment: A JSON string on the first line defining the script's configurable parameters. This allows the GUI to dynamically generate input widgets.Example format:# SCRIPT_SETTINGS: {"setting_key": {"type": "spinbox/doublespinbox/combobox", "label": "Display Name", "range": [min, max], "default": value, "step": value, "decimals": int, "items": ["Item1", "Item2"], "tooltip": "Help text"}}
"type": spinbox (integer), doublespinbox (float), combobox (dropdown)."label": Text displayed in the GUI."range": [min, max] for spinboxes."default": Default value."step": Increment for spinboxes."decimals": Number of decimal places for doublespinbox."items": List of strings for combobox."tooltip": Hover-over help text.run(settings, gcode_lines) function: This is the main entry point for your script.settings (dict): A dictionary containing all global settings (e.g., travel_speed, dwell_time, firmware) and your script-specific settings as defined in # SCRIPT_SETTINGS:. It also includes parsed G-code information like min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, max_z, total_layers, and bed_dimensions.gcode_lines (list of str): The original G-code content, line by line.Return Value: The function must return a tuple:A list of strings representing the modified G-code lines.A list of (x, y, z) tuples (floats) representing the calculated snapshot locations. These points will be displayed in the GCodeViewer.Script Example (my_custom_script.py)# SCRIPT_SETTINGS: {"my_custom_value": {"type": "spinbox", "label": "My Custom Setting", "range": [1, 10], "default": 5, "tooltip": "A custom setting."}}
